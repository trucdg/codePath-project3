# Web Development Project 2 - *SWE Flashcards - Part 2 üòé*

## Submitted by: **Truc Duong**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Inspiration 
In this project, I will be creating a web app for learning some fundamental concepts in math.
User will be able to use the study cards in a randomized order. 
I also build features that allow users to enter an answer (with exact or fuzzy matching) and move backwards and forwards through the list of cards.

Time spent: **__** hours spent in total

## üéØ Goals
By the end of this assignment I will be able to
- [x] Use `useState()` to create more state variables of different types
  - [x] Use state to change the visual appearance of the web app
  - [x] Use state to check that changes to other state are valid
- [x] Use the `onClick()` and `onChange()` events to call methods to adjust or reset state variables
- [x] Create space for user input with the `input` tag
- [x] Create more nested components in order to handle increasing complexity

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [x] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [x] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**
- [x] **A next button is displayed on the card and can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards
- [x] A user's answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
- [ ] A counter displays the user's current and longest streak of correct responses
- [ ] A user can mark a card that they have mastered and have it removed from the pool of answers as well as added to a list of mastered cards


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented required features:

## üß† Notes:
- I started the project pretty late. Thus, I didn't have more time for the stretches features before deadline
- I'm still a little bit confusing about whether I should store the state variables in the parent or the child component for easy manipulation. I wanted to ask this in OH but OH was too full and the TA didn't have enough time for every student. Will follow up with him about this.
